# Introduction to Relational Databases (SQL) 📊

## **Introduction to Relational Databases with Hardy**

### Welcome
  
  
In this lesson, we’ll explore the world of **relational databases** or **SQL**.

---

### Initial Analogy: Spreadsheets and Tables
- Have you ever worked with **tables** or **spreadsheets**?
- If so, you already have a good idea of how relational databases work.
- This is the closest analogy I can give for a relational database.

### What is a Relational Database?

- Relational databases (or SQL databases) store data in a **tabular format**, similar to a spreadsheet.  
- **Rows** represent individual records.  
- **Columns** represent specific attributes or fields.

### When to Use Relational Databases?

- They are ideal for data with a **well-structured format** that can easily fit into rows and columns.  
**Example:** User data.  
  - This data is structured because it can be organized into predefined fields, such as:
    - Email
    - Phone number
    - Address

---

### Examples of Relational Databases
- Some popular examples include:
  1. **MySQL**
  2. **PostgreSQL** 🐘

---

### Analogy: An Organized Library
- Think of a relational database as a **well-organized library**.
- Each book is categorized and placed in a specific location based on:
  - Title
  - Publisher
  - Cost

### Structured vs. Unstructured Data

**Structured Data:**
- Organized and follows a clear format (like a library).  
  - Example: Database tables.

**Unstructured Data:**
- Like a **storage room** filled with random items.  
  - Example: Boxes of documents, photos, videos, furniture, etc.  
  - There is no inherent structure to organize these items.

---

### Conclusion
- Relational databases are powerful tools for storing and managing structured data.  
- They provide an efficient way to organize information, just like a library organizes books.
